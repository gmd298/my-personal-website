            A year or two before I moved back to NYC, I got a computer. Initially, it was to stay in touch with close friends.
            Staying in touch quickly became just one of the perks of working with computers. When I was tasked with recovering photos from
            the old family PC, I used that oportunity to take the whole thing apart. A general interest became something more in the wake of COVID. No work. 
            Studios closed. Concerts and tours canceled. All I had was this computer.
            How could I survive in that world? Just need to adapt, I guess. The rules changed and I am grateful for that as well.
